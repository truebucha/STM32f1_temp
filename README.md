# STM32f1 for arduino 1.8 version (STM32f1 implemented)
based on repo https://github.com/rogerclarkmelbourne/Arduino_STM32

To make it work please copy files to the ~/Library/Arduino15 folder.
when you update the boards using arduino IDE you should place "package_STM32f_index.json" once again.

This repo works on mac, for linux or windows you will replace 
~/Library/Arduino15/packages/STM32f/tools/upload/1.0.0 using OS specific one from there

https://github.com/rogerclarkmelbourne/Arduino_STM32/tree/master/tools

This is "just to make it work" implementation, because I using more relevane IDE from PlatformIO now.
